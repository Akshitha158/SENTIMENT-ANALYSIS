## This file outlines a project in Sentiment Analysis, a key application of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The objective is to classify text data (like social media comments or reviews) into different sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). The proposed pipeline includes standard NLP steps: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (e.g., lowercasing, tokenizing), Feature Extraction using a CountVectorizer, and building a classification model like Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB). The expected output and final deliverable is a Classification Report that details the model's performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each predicted sentiment class.

OUTPUT:
